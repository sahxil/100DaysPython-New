my_function()

# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# The purpose of my_function is to print "You got it" when i=20 but i will never equal 20
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# for loop is running from i=1 till i=19
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# the function is meant to print "You got it" when i=20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# The assumption is that i will iterate till the upper range that is 20 while it iterates only till (n-1) range i.e. 20-1 which is 19
